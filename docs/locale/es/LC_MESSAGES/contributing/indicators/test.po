msgid "The test framework (in `build.rs`) reads `*.jsonl` files in the `tests/fixtures/indicators/` directory. Each `*.jsonl` file is prefixed with an indicator code: for example, `R038.jsonl` and `R038-tenderer.jsonl`. The test framework runs the `indicators` command with that indicator {ref}`enabled<enable-an-indicator>`, and compares the output to the corresponding `*.expected` file: for example, `R038.expected` and `R038-tenderer.expected`."
