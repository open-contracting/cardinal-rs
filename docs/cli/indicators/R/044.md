# Business similarities between suppliers (R044)

Different tenderers bidding for the same contracting process have similar information.

## Methodology

A contracting process is flagged if different tenderers have either the exact same address or any contact point fields.
These tenderers are also flagged.

:::{admonition} Example
:class: seealso

BribeCorp and AnotherBribeCorp submit bids to the same procurement process. Both companies use "Collusion Street 1" as their street address in the Atlantis country.

:::{admonition} Why is this a red flag?
:class: hint

Similarities between suppliers may indicate that the companies are connected.
